From Zach and Kaleah

This folder was copied from the cenote pipe (and seems to be from the old DCC pipe as well).
The python script that creates the shelf tools (create_shelf.py in the custom folder) imports things from this folder, but we believe it can be rewritten and most of this legacy code could
be deleted.

We didn't touch this folder at all. It is legacy code
